# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
## Description
I needed to create a password generator that would ask the user a bunch of questions to determine which keys would be inputted into the generated password. I had defined the variables at the begining and as I continued to create functions to determine what the user wanted, I added more to the top of the list. It was definitly a lot more challenging but I learned so much on how to do if statements, booleaans, functions, iterations and the differences between let and const variables.
